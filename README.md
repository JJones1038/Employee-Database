# Employee-Database

This is a simple web application that allows users to manage employee data. Users can perform operations such as listing current employees, creating new employees, updating existing employee information, and deleting employees from the database. The application uses AJAX requests to communicate with the API, and it displays the retrieved employee data in a table format on the web page.
